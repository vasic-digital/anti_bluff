-- anti_bluff SOL-01 custody triggers (TEMPLATE — applied via apply_custody.sh).
-- THE LOAD-BEARING DESIGN CHOICE: these live IN THE DATABASE FILE, so they bind
-- EVERY writer — the sanctioned mutation tool AND the raw `sqlite3 "UPDATE ..."`
-- bypass that the forensic record proved. A seam implemented in a wrapper tool
-- can be gone around; a trigger travels with the data it protects (through
-- clones, copies, and CoW tracks).
--
-- __AB_TERMINAL_LIST__ is substituted by apply_custody.sh from the consumer's
-- AB_TERMINAL_STATUSES (§11.4.35: vocabulary is consumer DATA; default
-- 'Fixed','Implemented','Completed'). Do NOT apply this file directly with
-- sqlite3 — use apply_custody.sh, which also makes the application idempotent
-- and proves the refusal live (§11.4.108 runtime signature).
--
-- The `Obsolete` path has a different evidence shape (obsolete-details) and is
-- OWED, not covered here — stated, never hidden (§11.4.6).

-- T1 — a terminal status is UNWRITABLE without the full custody chain:
--      registry row keyed by the EXACT item id
--      -> RED verdict with exit<>0
--      -> GREEN verdict with exit=0 on a DIFFERENT artifact fingerprint
--      (identical fingerprints prove the fix was never deployed, §11.4.115(F)).
